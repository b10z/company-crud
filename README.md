# Instructions:
Prerequisites: `Docker, make`

- Clone the repo. 
- `cd` into the project
- Run `make app.start`. 

These steps will launch the **service**, an initialized **DB**, and a **Kafka broker** with initialized topics.

# Short mention of the REST-endpoints: 

- POST - `/companies`
- GET - `/companies/{company_name}` 
- DELETE - `/companies/{company_name}`
- PATCH - `/companies/{company_name}`

For more details, please refer to SWAGGER.

# Information about testing:

An Integration-like test was implemented `cmd/company_crud/main_test.go`.
This test, utilizes a custom suite that uses a temporal DB and a Kafka broker. Then multiple cases run using actual client calls to the service, also the data are verified from the service and directly from the DB.
